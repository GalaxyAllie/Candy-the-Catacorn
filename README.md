# Candy the Catacorn

Catacorn Badge :D

## Background

I have wanted to learn more about electrical engineering and the 'hardware' side of things, so have started playing with dev boards including the Adafruit Trinket M0, which is the board that inspired this project. But none of them were catacorn enough, so I decided to make one :)

## Thanks

Thank you to the following people:

Ladyada and Adafruit - for building excellent products and teaching people electronics. I used a lot of Trinket M0's in prototyping this. Seriously, people, go buy their products - they're fantastic (and the boards are way cuter than some others, especially look at the Metro M4 Express - it's just adorable).

Various inspirations for the catacorn, but especially to the kid who asked me to paint their face as a catacorn when I was face painting some years ago. It was the first time I really started thinking what the features of a catacorn should be like. I hope you're doing well today, and I wish you all the best in life :) - also to the many people who've drawn catacorns (and caticorns and unicats) online, and I've taken inspiration from.

Q - for being an awesome friend who has helped with so much of the EDA side of working this all out.

Charlie - for coming up with the name Candy! I love you bestie :D
